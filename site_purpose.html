      The purpose of "studybooster.kg" is to help young people from CIS
      countries like Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan to study
      English as their second language. The website is built for those who are
      seeking to learn real-life american english and people who speak russian
      as their native language and want to find a teacher who can speak russian
      as well.
